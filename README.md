ong-Term Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the long-term stock price of a company based on its historical stock data.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras
Jupyter Notebook
Yahoo Finance API

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Collected using yfinance for TCS stock.
Includes:
Date
Open, High, Low, Close,Volume
Data stored in CSV format.

ðŸ“Š Features
100-day and 200-day Moving Averages
Normalized closing prices
Train-Test split: 70-30
